# Different-fitting-algorithms-and-ROC-for-deep-seated-landslide-sensors
Developed a fitting algorithm (LSTM,SG,SMA,ANN,LOWESS) to fit tilt sensor data and apply ROC to identify optimal alert threshold


This repository is consist of my codes done for Project Dynaslope under the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

The study is about finding a suitable fitting algorithm to fit the tilt sensor data used in monitoring for possible deep seated landslides
in 50 select sites in the Philippines.
